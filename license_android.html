            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br /><br />
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:<br /><br />

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br /><br />
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br /><br />
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />
            6. Trademarks.

            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br /><br />
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />

            <strong>DIGIMARC License</strong><br />
            This application (the “App”) contains components of Digimarc Corporation’s Digimarc Discover application (the “Digimarc Software”). Use of the Digimarc Software is subject to the following terms and conditions (the “Agreement”). By installing or otherwise using this application, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.<br /><br />
            You are not allowed to install or use the Digimarc Software if you are under the age of 13.<br /><br />
            Effective Date: The date you accept this Agreement.<br /><br />
            Last Updated: December 13, 2017.<br /><br />
            1. Acceptance. By installing or using the App, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to use the App.<br /><br />
            2. License. Digimarc hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, personal license to use the Digimarc Software for non-commercial purposes.<br /><br />
            3. Data Collection and Use. In connection with your use of the App, Digimarc may collect, store, use, and disclose to third parties the information identified in Digimarc’s privacy policy, as described in the privacy policy: http://www.digimarc.com/discover/privacypolicy (the “Privacy Policy”). This information includes a hashed version of your device’s unique device identifier and your device’s IP address. If you are using an old version of the Digimarc Software, this information may also include geo-location information, if you agree to provide that information to Digimarc. Digimarc does not store or use geo-location information or disclose geo-location information to third parties.<br /><br />
            By using the App, you consent to the activities of Digimarc described in this section and in the Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
            Digimarc may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to the Privacy Policy are effective when Digimarc publishes the revised Privacy Policy. You can tell if the Privacy Policy has been updated by reviewing the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of the Privacy Policy. You agree to review the Privacy Policy from time to time.<br /><br />
            4. Copying and Reverse Engineering. You shall not copy, replicate, modify, adapt, translate, alter, decompile, disassemble, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works, in whole or in part from, the Digimarc Software. If you create derivative works in violation of this Agreement, those works belong to Digimarc, and you hereby assign all rights and title to those works to Digimarc. If the retailer through which you obtain the App has usage restrictions or imposes any other terms and conditions on the use of mobile applications made available by that retailer, you shall comply with those restrictions and other terms and conditions.<br /><br />
            5. Third Party Services. Third party websites and services may be accessible using the Digimarc Software (“Services”). Digimarc is not responsible for examining or evaluating Services. Digimarc reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice to you.<br /><br />
            6. Ownership. The Digimarc Software is not sold to you. Digimarc retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Digimarc Software. You agree not to challenge any aspect of Digimarc’s rights in the Digimarc Software.<br /><br />
            7. Termination. This Agreement will remain in effect until terminated. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason without notice to the other party. On termination, your license to use the App will expire, and you must cease using and uninstall all copies of the App. Use of the Digimarc Software after termination will violate Digimarc’s intellectual property rights. Sections 3-13 of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.<br /><br />
            8. WARRANTY DISCLAMER. THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DIGIMARC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS AS TO HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY MAY LAST. TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED, ANY SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO NINETY (90) DAYS.<br /><br />
            9. EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY. DIGIMARC IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE ARISING FROM ANY CLAIM OR ACTION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, EVEN IF DIGIMARC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. AS A RESULT, THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL DIGIMARC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED $5.00.<br /><br />
            10. Notices. Notices to Digimarc must be sent by registered, pre-paid, certified mail, return receipt requested, to Digimarc’s address listed above or Digimarc’s then-current address as posted on Digimarc’s web site at: http://www.digimarc.com. A notice is effective when received or when the return receipt shows the notice was rejected.<br /><br />
            11. Export Rules. You shall not ship, transfer, or export the Digimarc Software to, or use the Digimarc Software in, any country prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions, or regulations (collectively, “Export Laws”). You represent and warrant that you are not a citizen of or located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been otherwise designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country (including Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, and North Korea), and that you are not on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, or otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from using the Digimarc Software.<br /><br />
            12. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, is governed by laws of the State of Oregon, USA, excluding its conflict of law provisions. The state and federal courts of Portland, Oregon, USA have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. You irrevocably waive any objection to the jurisdiction of those courts. You shall not assign this Agreement to any third party without Digimarc’s prior written consent. Any purported assignment in violation of these terms is void from its inception. Digimarc may assign this Agreement to any third party without your consent. The retailer through which you obtain the Digimarc Software is a third party beneficiary under this Agreement, and that retailer has the right to enforce this Agreement against you.<br /><br />
            13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete agreement between the parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all earlier agreements and discussions regarding the Digimarc Software. This Agreement may only be modified by a writing signed by Digimarc.<br /><br />
